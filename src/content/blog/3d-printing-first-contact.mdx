I'm a member of the [BCN Engineering](https://bcneng.org/) community Slack and there's a #3d-printing channel, so I asked there for help and recommendations for getting started in the 3D printing world. I got some advice and links to resources.

They recommended to create profiles in the following websites and start exploring 3D models to see what I would like to print and learn about modelling:

- [Printables](https://www.printables.com)
- [Cults 3D](https://cults3d.com)
- [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com)
- [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com)

I found a couple of nice videos as well:

- [How 3D printing works - Step by Step Example (in Spanish)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCB3cM4IZQk): introductory video for absolute beginners, very well explained, useful intro with basic concepts 👌

- [The ONLY Beginners Guide to 3D Printing You Need!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8qA8GEMu8Y): similar to the previous one, very useful for absolute beginners, ELI5.

I found out they are offering this free course near my place: ["Introducció a la impressió 3D"](https://www.esplugues.cat/ciutat/agenda/introduccio-a-la-impressio-3d/), I'll try to sign up, it may be a good way to get some hands-on experience.
