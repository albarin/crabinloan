I'm a member of the [BCN Engineering](https://bcneng.org/) community Slack, and there's a #3d-printing channel, so I asked there for help and recommendations for getting started in the 3D printing world. I got some advice and links to resources.

They recommended creating profiles on the following websites and starting to explore 3D models to see what I would like to print and to learn about modeling:

- [Printables](https://www.printables.com)
- [Cults 3D](https://cults3d.com)
- [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com)
- [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com)


I also found a couple of nice videos:


- [How 3D printing works - Step by Step Example (in Spanish)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCB3cM4IZQk): An introductory video for absolute beginners, very well explained, and a useful intro with basic concepts 👌

- [The ONLY Beginners Guide to 3D Printing You Need!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8qA8GEMu8Y): Similar to the previous one, very useful for absolute beginners, ELI5.


I found out they are offering this free course near my place: ["Introducció a la impressió 3D"](https://www.esplugues.cat/ciutat/agenda/introduccio-a-la-impressio-3d/). I'll try to sign up; it may be a good way to get some hands-on experience.
