I spent the week watching lots of videos, researching different models of printers, brands, filaments, etc. It was a bit overwhelming, but after a lot of thinking and back-and-forth between differents options I decided to go for the [Bambu Lab P1S Combo](https://eu.store.bambulab.com/products/p1s). I got a good offer since it was Black Friday, we'll see if it was worth it or it was too much for a complete beginner like me. 

I seriously considered getting a Bambu Lab A1 instead, but in the end the enclosure and possibility to print with more advanced materials in the future convinced me to go for the P1S 🤷‍♀️
