I spent the week watching lots of videos and researching different models of printers, brands, filaments, etc. It was a bit overwhelming, but after a lot of thinking and going back and forth between different options, I decided to go for the [Bambu Lab P1S Combo](https://eu.store.bambulab.com/products/p1s). I got a good offer since it was Black Friday. We'll see if it was worth it or if it was too much for a complete beginner like me.

I seriously considered getting a Bambu Lab A1 instead, but in the end, the enclosure and the possibility to print with more advanced materials in the future convinced me to go for the P1S 🤷‍♀️
