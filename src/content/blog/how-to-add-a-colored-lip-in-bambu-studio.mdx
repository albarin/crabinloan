When I printed my first Gridfinity box, I wanted to add a thin colored lip as an accent to match the baseplate. At first, I tried to find a model that already included the lip, but I couldn’t find one that fit my needs. So, I decided to figure out how to do it myself in Bambu Studio. It’s actually pretty straightforward!


1. Open or import your model in Bambu Studio.
2. Make sure your project has more than one filament loaded (for example, white and blue). You can add a new filament by clicking the `+` (`Add one filament`) icon in the `Project Filaments` sidebar on the left. This step is important, otherwise, you won’t be able to assign different filaments to different parts of the model.

3. Click `Preview` in the top menu, then `Slice plate` to generate the sliced model.
4. On the right side, you’ll see a bar with a `+` icon that you can drag up and down to select different layers of the model. Move it to the height where you want the colored lip to start.
5. Right-click the `+` icon, select `Change Filament`, and choose the filament you want to use for the lip (blue, in this example).

6. Click `Slice plate` again to update the sliced model with the new filament assignment.
7. You should now see the lip in the new color in the preview!
8. Check the `Slicing Result` section to make sure both filaments are listed and the number of filament changes looks correct.
