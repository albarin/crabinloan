I have a list of a few useful prints that I have been planning to make since I bought the P1S printer.
For now, all my "projects" are simple: I usually browse models on [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com), download them, and print them as they are, without modifications.


These are some of the prints I want to make in the next few days:
- Sewer cover
- Under-desk drawer
- White door hooks
- Soap dispenser for the kitchen
- Gridfinity organizers for the bathroom drawers
- Egg holder for the fridge
- Kobo eReader case


I started with the door hooks, since I figured they would be an easy win. I found this 
[35mm Over Door Hook / Hanger](https://makerworld.com/en/models/196347-35mm-over-door-hook-hanger?from=search#profileId-216967) 
model, which looked perfect for my door. It printed great and fit perfectly, but the hook part that holds onto the door is a bit too short,
so whenever I took some clothes from it, the whole hook would come off the door. I wanted to modify the model to make that part longer, but I
failed miserably, as I don't have any experience with 3D modeling yet.

After browsing a bit more, I found this [Simple Door Hook Generator](https://makerworld.com/en/models/493470-simple-door-hook-generator-openscad-customizable#profileId-407205),
which was exactly what I needed, as it allows you to customize the dimensions of every single part of the hook to your needs.
I generated a new model with a longer hook part and printed it, and this time it holds much better!

I had to increase the width by 1mm for it to be a perfect fit for my door, but other than that, it was perfect.
Once I made sure the dimensions were correct, I used the clone tool in Bambu Studio to create 7 more copies of the model in the same print job, so I could print all the hooks I needed at once.
It's great that the cloning feature is able to automatically arrange the models on the print bed for you 👌


I'm satisfied with how they look on the door, and I can always print more if I need to expand my hanging capacity!
