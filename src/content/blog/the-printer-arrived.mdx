Finally the waiting is over, my Bambu Lab P1s Combo has arrived! 🎉
I was preparing for the moment for a few days, so I had this video prepared for when it arrived. It was very useful. The process is not complex at all, but there are a few screws and pieces here and there that you need to remove and assemble, so better safe than sorry:

I thought my delivery was wrong when I opened the box and saw only the printer, I though they forgot to include the AMS, but it turns out it comes inside the printer itself 🤭
I was also surprised to see it came with three PLA filament spools, I expected none, so that was a nice bonus even though they were only 250g each (green, orange and white).

I was hoping to use a spare Besta module I have from my old home office to put the printer on, but I wasn't sure whether it would fit or the vibration would be a problem. It turns out it fits perfectly and for now the vibration is not an issue at all, so I'm happy with that minimal setup for to start with.

The first thing I printed is, of course, the famous benchy. The model came preloaded in the printer's SD card, so I just had to select it from the screen and start printing. I choose orange PLA for it, and the result was nice!
