Finally, the waiting is over—my Bambu Lab P1S Combo has arrived! 🎉
I had been preparing for this moment for a few days, so I had this video ready for when it arrived. It was very useful. The process is not complex at all, but there are a few screws and pieces here and there that you need to remove and assemble, so better safe than sorry:

I thought my delivery was wrong when I opened the box and saw only the printer. I thought they had forgotten to include the AMS, but it turns out it comes inside the printer itself 🤭
I was also surprised to see it came with three PLA filament spools—I expected none—so that was a nice bonus, even though they were only 250g each (green, orange, and white).


I was hoping to use a spare Besta module I have from my old home office to put the printer on, but I wasn't sure whether it would fit or if vibration would be a problem. It turns out it fits perfectly, and for now vibration is not an issue at all, so I'm happy with that minimal setup to start with.

The first thing I printed was, of course, the famous Benchy. The model came preloaded on the printer's SD card, so I just had to select it from the screen and start printing. I chose orange PLA for it, and the result was nice!
