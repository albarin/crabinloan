                    This is my learning path with 3d printing. I will share resources I found useful to
                    learn basic concepts: videos, articles, websites, model repositories and other stuff
                    I found along the way. There may be wrong information as I'm still learning, so take
                    everything you read with a grain of salt and make your own research.

                    I spent the week watching lots of videos, researching different models of printers, brands, filaments,
                    etc. It was a bit overwhelming, but after a lot of thinking and back-and-forth between differents
                    options I decided to go for the <a href="https://eu.store.bambulab.com/products/p1s" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Bambu Lab P1S Combo</a>, I got a good offer since it was Black Friday,
                    we'll see if it was worth it or it was too much for a complete beginner like me. I seriously considered
                    getting a Bambu Lab A1 instead, but in the end the enclosure and possibility to print with more advanced
                    materials in the future convinced me to go for the P1S 🤷‍♀️

                    I'm a member of the <a href="https://bcneng.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BCN
                        Engineering</a> community Slack
                    and there's a #3d-printing channel, so I asked there for help and recommendations for
                    getting started in the 3D printing world. I got some advice and links to resources.

                    They recommended to create profiles in the follwing websites and start exploring 3D models
                    to see what I would like to print and learn about modelling:
